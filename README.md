# Farmerce

## Inspiration

With covid-19 restrictions being lifted and local farmer's markets starting up in many places, people have a chance to expose themselves while being outside. Farmerce aims to reduce the chance for exposure while acting as a platform that connects customers to vendors by showing them information such as the methods of production, contact information, and items for sale. This will revolutionize the agricultural industry through an easy-to-use web app that gives users important information.

## What it does

Farmerce is an online platform that connects customers to vendors at local farmer's markets. It provides customers the option to view information about a specific vendor such as items for sale, contact information, and methods of growing. It also provides users the chance to take pictures of produce and determine if the plant has a disease or not. 
 ##Plant detection AI
We used Keras and sklearn to effectively create a CNN that identifies plants with diseases. We obtained a 97% accuracy by training our data on a separate machine for 3+ hours.

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into
Since part of our team is in the east coast, it was very hard to communicate with them and sometimes our teammates had to stay up hours and hours on end working. This took a toll on the overall mental health of our team because we were near exhaustion. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Implementing Mongo DB to create a unique profile for each farmer
Our UI design, which makes our app user-friendly.
Creating an AI to detect plant diseases.


## What we learned
We learned a lot about using data to predict and train our models.

## What's next for Farmerce

We plan on using all the different aspects on our project and reach out to local farmers markets and spread awareness of our platform. We believe that without our platform, it will help consumers feel more confident about the food they are getting while also building trust and encouraging higher quality produce.
